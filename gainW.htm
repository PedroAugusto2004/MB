    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Gaining weight and building muscle mass is a common goal for those looking to improve their physique and
        overall strength. However, it's important to approach this goal with a well-structured plan that includes a
        balanced diet, proper exercise, and adequate rest.

    <h2>Diet for Gaining Weight</h2>
    <p>
        Diet plays a crucial role in gaining weight and muscle mass. It's essential to consume more calories than
        your body burns. Focus on nutrient-dense foods that provide a good balance of protein, carbohydrates, and
        healthy fats. Some examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lean meats like chicken, beef, and turkey</li>
        <li>Complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>Healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and olive oil</li>
        <li>Protein-rich foods such as eggs, dairy products, and legumes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exercise for Muscle Growth</h2>
    <p>
        To build muscle mass, strength training is essential. Focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle
        groups, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Squats</li>
        <li>Deadlifts</li>
        <li>Bench press</li>
        <li>Overhead press</li>
        <li>Pull-ups</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's important to progressively increase the weight and intensity of your workouts to continue making
        gains. Consistency is key, so make sure to stick to your workout routine.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Gaining weight and building muscle mass requires dedication to both your diet and exercise routine. By
        focusing on consuming enough calories, prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, and following a structured
        strength training program, you can achieve your goals. Remember to give your body adequate time to recover
        and grow, as rest is just as important as the work you put in at the gym.
